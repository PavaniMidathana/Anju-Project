                <p class="detailed-view-card-description">
                    The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural
                    achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its
                    recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids
                    and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and
                    domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. Not a piece of
                    architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an
                    emperor’s love wrought in living stones.The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion.The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
                    
                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
